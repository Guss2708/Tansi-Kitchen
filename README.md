# Tansi Kitchen

The Tansi Kitchen is a local family business established in 2020. They started out modestly supplying their handmade ravioli and artisan breads, including sourdough loaves, to people putting together produce boxes for online stores, and quickly evolved into a thriving business from our farm outside Lusaka.  They supply small shops and delicatessens in Lusaka, with all kinds of pasta and sauces, including ravioli, tagliatelle, spaghetti, ready to cook lasagne, as well as bread and sourdough.

The web site aims to promote the products, showcase the various products, provide information about the history of the business, facilitate online ordering, build brand awarenes to a wider audience, and it will also help build customer loyalty by providing a convenient and reliable platform for customers to purchase their favorite products.
